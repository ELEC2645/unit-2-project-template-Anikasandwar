Question 1: What is an RC circuit and where is it used mainly?

Answer 1: An RC circuit is a simple electrical circuit that uses a resistor and a
capacitor. It is used to control how an electrical signal behaves over time. The
resistor slows down the flow of current while the capacitor stores and releases
charge. Together they determine how quickly the circuit responds, based on the
time constant (τ = R × C). RC circuits are commonly used in practical
electronics, such as filtering audio signals, creating time delays in timer circuits,
smoothing out power supply voltage, debouncing mechanical switches, and
conditioning signals from sensors.

Question 2: Explain the charging and discharging process in detail.

Answer 2: Charging: When a capacitor in an RC circuit begins charging, it starts
from zero volts. As soon as the voltage source is connected, current flows through
the resistor and into the capacitor. At the very beginning, the capacitor behaves
almost like a short circuit because it has no stored charge, so the current is at its
maximum. As the capacitor fills with charge, its voltage gradually increases, and
the difference between the supply voltage and the capacitor voltage becomes
smaller. The current flowing through the resistor decreases over time. The
charging process follows an exponential curve: the capacitor charges quickly at
first and then more slowly as it approaches the supply voltage. After one time
constant (τ = R × C), the capacitor reaches about 63% of the supply voltage, and
after around five time constants, it is considered fully charged.

Discharging: When a capacitor in an RC circuit begins discharging, it starts with
stored energy and a voltage across its plates. Once the circuit is switched to allow
discharge, the capacitor releases its stored charge through the resistor. At the
beginning of the discharge, the current is at its highest because the voltage across
the capacitor is still large. As the capacitor loses charge, its voltage gradually
drops. The current through the resistor also decreases over time. Like charging,
the discharge process follows an exponential curve: it happens quickly at first and
then slows down as the capacitor approaches zero volts. After one time constant
(τ = R × C), the voltage drops to about 37% of its original value, and after about
five time constants, the capacitor is considered fully discharged.

Question 3: What is time constant and how does the capacitor act differently at t=0
and at a steady state?

Answer 3: The time constant, τ, is a measure of how quickly an RC circuit charges
or discharges. It is calculated as the product of resistance and capacitance (τ = R ×
C). It tells us how long it takes for the capacitor’s voltage to reach about 63% of
its final value during charging, or to drop to about 37% of its initial value during
discharging. At t = 0, the capacitor has no stored charge, so it behaves like a
short circuit—allowing maximum current to flow through the resistor. At steady
state (after about five time constants), the capacitor becomes fully charged and
behaves like an open circuit, meaning no current flows through it and the voltage
across the capacitor reaches the supply voltage.
