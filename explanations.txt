V=IR: Voltage is calculated by multiplying Current and Resistance 
I=V/R: Current is calculated by dividing Voltage and Resistance 
R=V/I: Resistance is calculated by dividing Voltage and Current
P=VI: Power is calculated by multiplying Voltage and Current 
V=P/I: Voltage in this contect can also be calculated by dividing Power and Current 
I=P/V: Current in this context can also be calculated by Dividing power and voltage
