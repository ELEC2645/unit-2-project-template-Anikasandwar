Question 1: What is Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and Voltage Law (KVL)?

Answer 1: Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) states that the sum of currents entering a
node (or junction) in an electrical circuit is equal to the sum of currents leaving
that node. In other words, total current flowing into a junction equals total
current flowing out, which is a consequence of the conservation of electric charge.

Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) states that the sum of all voltages around any
closed loop in a circuit is zero. This is because voltage is a measure of energy per
charge, and energy gained and lost around a complete loop must balance out.
KVL ensures the conservation of energy in electrical circuits.

Question 2: What is Thevenin’s Theorem? How do you find Thevenin equivalent?

Answer 2: Thevenin’s Theorem states that any linear electrical network with
resistors and sources can be replaced by a single voltage source (Vth) in series
with a single resistor (Rth) connected to the load. This simplifies complex
circuits into an easier-to-analyze equivalent.

To find the Thevenin equivalent:
1. Remove the load resistor from the circuit.
2. Calculate the open-circuit voltage across the terminals where the load was
   connected. This is Vth.
3. Turn off all independent voltage sources (replace with short circuits) and
   current sources (replace with open circuits), then calculate the equivalent
   resistance seen from the terminals. This is Rth.
4. The Thevenin equivalent circuit is a voltage source Vth in series with Rth.

Question 3: What is the superposition theorem?

Answer 3: The superposition theorem states that in a linear circuit with multiple
independent sources, the voltage or current at any element is the algebraic sum
of the contributions from each independent source acting alone, while all other
independent sources are turned off (voltage sources shorted, current sources
opened). This allows complex circuits with multiple sources to be analyzed
one source at a time, making calculations simpler.
