Question 1: What is the definition of power (P = VI) in DC and AC circuits?

Answer 1: In DC circuits, power (P) is the product of voltage (V) and current (I):
P = V × I. It represents the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or
delivered by a circuit element.

In AC circuits, power depends on both voltage and current and their phase
relationship. Instantaneous power varies with time, but the average power over
a cycle is given by P = Vrms × Irms × cos(φ), where φ is the phase difference
between voltage and current, and cos(φ) is called the power factor.

Question 2: What is real, reactive, and apparent power?

Answer 2: Real power (P) is the actual power consumed by a load to perform
useful work, measured in watts (W). It represents energy converted into work
or heat.

Reactive power (Q) is the power stored and released by reactive components
(inductors and capacitors) in the circuit. It does no real work but causes
current to oscillate, measured in volt-amperes reactive (VAR).

Apparent power (S) is the combination of real and reactive power, given by
S = √(P² + Q²), measured in volt-amperes (VA). It represents the total
power supplied by the source.

Question 3: What is power factor and why is it important?

Answer 3: Power factor (PF) is the ratio of real power to apparent power:
PF = P / S = cos(φ). It indicates how effectively the electrical power is
being converted into useful work. A high power factor (close to 1) means
efficient use of electrical power, while a low power factor leads to wasted
energy and higher current in the system, requiring larger wires and
increased losses. Improving power factor reduces energy costs and improves
system efficiency.
